# Varana Programming Language Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation of **Varana**, a modern, intuitive, and expressive programming language designed for clarity, productivity, and educational purposes.

## 🦎 Introduction to Varana

Varana is a lightweight, powerful, and highly readable programming language inspired by modern languages such as Python, Rust, and JavaScript. Named after the agile and intelligent monitor lizards (genus *Varanus*), Varana aims to blend ease of learning with sophisticated features suitable for various applications.

## 🚀 Features

- **Clean & Intuitive Syntax:** Easy to read and write, reducing cognitive overhead.
- **Static Typing with Type Inference:** Catch errors early without verbose type annotations.
- **First-Class Functions and Closures:** Enables elegant functional programming styles.
- **Built-in Data Structures:** Rich support for Arrays, Dictionaries, Tuples, and more.
- **Automatic Memory Management:** Built-in garbage collector ensures simplicity and safety.
- **Modular Architecture:** Simple import/export system to enhance modularity.
- **Cross-Platform:** Portable bytecode execution through Varana Virtual Machine (VVM).

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Hello World Example

```varana
fn main() {
    print("Hello, Varana!")
}
```

### Installation
*(Note: Currently conceptual. Implementation details coming soon.)*

```
# Future installation command
varana install
```

## 📖 Language Guide

### Variables and Types

Varana supports both explicit and inferred typing:

```varana
let username = "Alice"
let age: Int = 30
let pi = 3.14159
```

### Control Flow

Varana supports standard control-flow structures:

```varana
if temperature > 25 {
    print("It's warm today!")
} else {
    print("Consider wearing a jacket.")
}

for i in 0..10 {
    print(i)
}
```

### Functions & Closures

Functions are first-class citizens:

```varana
fn add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}

let multiply = |x, y| x * y
```

### Structures

Varana supports custom data structures:

```varana
struct Point {
    x: Int,
    y: Int
}

let p = Point(10, 20)
print("X is ${p.x}, Y is ${p.y}")
```

## 📦 Modules & Packages

Varana has a clean modular system:

```varana
// math.vrn
export fn square(x: Int): Int {
    return x * x
}

// main.vrn
import math from "./math.vrn"
print(math.square(4)) // outputs 16
```

## ⚙️ Standard Library Overview

Varana includes a versatile standard library with modules such as:

- **IO Module:** File handling, input/output operations.
- **Math Module:** Common mathematical functions.
- **Collections Module:** Data structures like arrays, dictionaries, sets.
- **Networking Module:** Socket and basic networking support.

## 🖥️ Varana Virtual Machine (VVM)

Varana programs compile down to portable bytecode executed by the Varana Virtual Machine, a stack-based VM ensuring cross-platform compatibility and high-performance execution.
